## 85. What are the types of files present in Linux OS?

Linux OS supports seven major types of files, each serving a different purpose in the system.
| File Type               | Identifier | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular (ordinary) file | -          | Contains user data such as text, images, executables, or code.                     |
| Directory               | d          | Contains names and addresses of other files/directories.                           |
| Symbolic link (symlink) | l          | Points to another file (similar to shortcuts).                                     |
| Block device file       | b          | Represents devices that require block-oriented I/O (e.g. disks).                   |
| Character device file   | c          | Represents devices requiring character-oriented I/O (e.g. keyboard, serial ports). |
| FIFO (named pipe)       | p          | Supports one-way process communication.                                            |
| Socket file             | s          | Used for network and inter-process two-way communication.                          |
